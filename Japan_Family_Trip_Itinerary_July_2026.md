# Japan Family Trip (14 nights) — Tokyo • Kyoto • Osaka — **Arrive Tue July 14, 2026**

This plan is built for:
- **Teens (16, 14):** anime, arcades, Pokémon (singles + sealed)
- **Art-focused:** immersive digital art + museums + craft culture
- **July reality:** heat + crowds → **early mornings + indoor afternoons**

---

## Snapshot

**Dates:** Tue **7/14** → Tue **7/28** (14 nights)  
**Route:** Tokyo (6N) → Kyoto (5N) → Osaka (3N) → fly home (best from **KIX** / Itami, or return to Tokyo if your flights require it)

**Festival highlights in this window**
- **Gion Matsuri (Kyoto):** float parades **7/17** & **7/24** (morning), mikoshi processions **7/17** & **7/24** (evening)  citeturn0search4turn0search9  
- **Tenjin Matsuri (Osaka):** **7/24–7/25** (big boat/fireworks elements on **7/25**) citeturn0search5turn0search15turn0search10  

> Note: Tokyo’s Sumidagawa fireworks are also “last Saturday of July,” which is **7/25** in 2026—this conflicts with Tenjin’s biggest night. If you *must* see Sumidagawa, I’ve put an optional swap near the end. citeturn0search6turn0search16

## What needs advance reservations (do these first)

### Must-book / strongly recommended
1) **PokéPark KANTO** — tickets sell fast  
   - The official ticket site notes **sales begin at 6:00 PM JST**, and admissions are offered up to **two months in advance** (date-specific). citeturn0search2  
   - Plan: book the **moment your desired date/time opens**.

2) **Pokémon Cafe (Tokyo: Nihombashi / Osaka: Shinsaibashi area)**  
   - Reservations open **6:00 PM JST, 31 days before** the desired date. citeturn0search18  

3) **Ghibli Museum (Mitaka, Tokyo)**  
   - **Advance reservation only**; no tickets sold at the museum. citeturn1search0  

4) **teamLab Planets TOKYO (Toyosu)**  
   - **Timed-entry** tickets; **not sold on-site**. citeturn1search9turn1search13  

5) **Universal Studios Japan (optional day)**  
   - July can be brutal for lines. Buy Studio Pass + consider **Express Pass in advance**. citeturn1search18turn1search10  

### Optional reservations (nice-to-have)
- **Paid street-side seats for Gion Matsuri parade** (if you want guaranteed views). citeturn0search4  
- Specific craft workshops in Kyoto (dyeing/pottery) — book if you see one your wife loves.

---

## Hotel shortlists (family-friendly, good locations)

I’m prioritizing **apartment-style rooms** (more space + laundry + fridge), which is a sanity saver in July.

### Tokyo (6 nights total) — best bases
**Where to stay:** Asakusa / Ueno (easier pacing + museums) **or** Shinjuku (big-city energy + transit)

**Apartment-hotel picks**
- **MIMARU** (Tokyo locations; rooms for 4–6+; kitchen/dining) citeturn1search15turn1search7  
  - *Great specific options:*  
    - **MIMARU Tokyo Asakusa Station** (super convenient) citeturn1search3  
    - **MIMARU SUITES Tokyo Asakusa** (2-bedroom suites) citeturn1search11  
    - **MIMARU Tokyo Shinjuku West** (if you want Shinjuku base) citeturn1search7  

### Kyoto (5 nights)
**Where to stay:** Downtown (Shijo/Kawaramachi) for food + walks, or Kyoto Station for rail ease.

- **MIMARU (Kyoto locations)** (multiple convenient properties) citeturn3search0turn3search4  
  - **MIMARU Kyoto Station** (excellent rail base) citeturn3search12  
  - **MIMARU Kyoto Kawaramachi Gojo** (great for Higashiyama/Gion area) citeturn3search15  
- **Tokyu Stay Kyoto Sanjo-Karasuma** (strong location; good for longer stays) citeturn3search3  

### Osaka (3 nights)
**Where to stay:** Namba / Nipponbashi (walkable food + card shops + shopping)

- **MIMARU Osaka Namba Station** (steps from the action) citeturn3search1  
- **MIMARU Osaka Namba North** (still close, slightly calmer) citeturn3search5

## Pokémon shopping game plan (how to avoid tourist traps)

### The “smart buyer” rules
- **Buy singles** after you’ve compared **2–3 shops** in the same neighborhood.
- Avoid “mystery packs” and flashy “guaranteed hits” vending machines unless you’re treating it as entertainment.
- For sealed: Pokémon Centers are great for **official, current products**; for older sealed, prices can climb quickly.
- Consider using **card sleeves/toploaders** right away—Japan shops often sell excellent supplies.

### Official Pokémon Centers (anchors for sealed + merch + exclusives)
Tokyo:
- **Pokémon Center MEGA TOKYO (Ikebukuro / Sunshine City)** citeturn2search0  
- **Pokémon Center SHIBUYA (Shibuya PARCO)** citeturn2search1  
- **Pokémon Center TOKYO DX & Pokémon Cafe (Nihombashi Takashimaya)** citeturn2search2  

Osaka:
- **Pokémon Center OSAKA DX & Café** (best paired with Dotonbori/Shinsaibashi)

### Reputable “community” card shops (Tokyo & Osaka)
**Tokyo — Akihabara (high density)**
- Spend a focused **2–3 hour block** inside/around Akihabara’s hobby buildings (especially Radio Kaikan area). citeturn2search9turn2search14  
  - Look for well-established chains such as **Card Labo** / **FullComp** / **Hobby Station** (often near the same cluster). citeturn2search14turn2search19  

**Tokyo — Ikebukuro (pair with Pokémon Center MEGA TOKYO)**
- Make this your “sealed + official merch” day, plus one or two nearby singles shops if you spot them.

**Tokyo — Nakano Broadway (treasure-hunt vibe)**
- Great for “unexpected finds” and older collectibles; treat it as browsing + selective buying.

**Osaka — Nipponbashi / Namba (card-hunting neighborhood)**
- Plan 1–2 blocks for walking between multiple shops; compare prices before you buy.

> Pro move: use the official Pokémon TCG shop/event map to find stores that actively run Pokémon events (usually a good sign they’re real community shops). citeturn2search3turn2search8

## Logistics notes (fast, practical)

### Trains

- Kyoto ↔ Osaka: quick local/limited express options; easy day trips.

- **Midday:** museums, arcades, shopping complexes  
- Carry a small towel + electrolytes.

### Pokémon buying “workflow”
1) Create a **target list** (10–20 singles, plus a few sealed products you’re hoping to find)
2) First pass = price discovery  
3) Second pass = buy (after you’ve compared)

## If you want, I can tailor one more layer
If you tell me:
- your preferred **Tokyo neighborhood** (Asakusa/Ueno vs Shinjuku vs Tokyo Station),
- whether USJ is a **must**,
- and whether you want **Pokémon Cafe** in Tokyo, Osaka, or both,

…I’ll tighten this into a “ready-to-book” version with exact transit steps per day and a shopping target checklist.
