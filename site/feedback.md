## Open Decisions

### ~~1. Universal Studios Japan~~ — DECIDED: Skip

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Decision:</strong> We're skipping USJ this trip. Day 10 is now a relaxed Nara day trip (deer park + giant Buddha). We can always do USJ at the US parks another time!</p>

### 2. Pokemon Cafe — Where?

Options:
- **Tokyo only** (Day 3 Shibuya area, or pair with Day 13 Ikebukuro)
- **Osaka only** (Day 9, pair with Pokemon Center Osaka DX)
- **Both!** (if we can get reservations)

**Your vote:** Comment with your preference

### 3. Sumidagawa Fireworks Swap?

**Sat 7/25** we're currently planned to be in Osaka for Tenjin Matsuri (boats + fireworks).

**Alternative:** Go back to Tokyo for Sumidagawa Fireworks (one of Japan's biggest).

**Trade-off:** Miss Tenjin's biggest night, but Sumidagawa is legendary.

**Your vote:** Comment with "Tenjin" or "Sumidagawa"

### 4. teamLab Planets — Add it?

Immersive digital art museum in Tokyo. Very popular, ~2 hours.

**When:** Would need to fit into Tokyo days (Day 2-3 or Day 13). Day 14 is PokePark, Day 15 is departure.

**Your vote:** Comment if interested + when you'd want to go
