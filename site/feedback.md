## Open Decisions

### 1. Universal Studios Japan — Go or Skip?

**Day 10 (Thu 7/23)** is currently planned for USJ.

**Pros:**
- Nintendo World is incredible
- Great for the whole family
- Air-conditioned attractions

**Cons:**
- July crowds are intense
- Expensive (tickets + Express Pass)
- Full day commitment

**Your vote:** Comment below with 👍 (go) or 👎 (skip)

### 2. Pokemon Cafe — Where?

Options:
- **Tokyo only** (Day 2-3 area, near Pokemon Center DX)
- **Osaka only** (Day 9, pair with Pokemon Center Osaka)
- **Both!** (if we can get reservations)

**Your vote:** Comment with your preference

### 3. Sumidagawa Fireworks Swap?

**Sat 7/25** we're currently planned to be in Osaka for Tenjin Matsuri (boats + fireworks).

**Alternative:** Go back to Tokyo for Sumidagawa Fireworks (one of Japan's biggest).

**Trade-off:** Miss Tenjin's biggest night, but Sumidagawa is legendary.

**Your vote:** Comment with "Tenjin" or "Sumidagawa"

### 4. teamLab Planets — Add it?

Immersive digital art museum in Tokyo. Very popular, ~2 hours.

**When:** Would need to fit into Tokyo days (Day 1-3 or Day 13-15)

**Your vote:** Comment if interested + when you'd want to go
