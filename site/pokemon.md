# Pokemon Shopping Game Plan

Strategy for finding the best cards and merch without overpaying.

---

## The Smart Buyer Rules

1. **Compare before buying** — Visit 2-3 shops before purchasing singles
2. **Skip mystery packs** — Tourist-trap vending machines rarely pay off
3. **Official for current, shops for older** — Pokemon Centers have great current stock; card shops for vintage
4. **Protect your purchases** — Bring sleeves/toploaders or buy them immediately
5. **Use the price discovery pass** — First shop visit = look and note prices. Second visit = buy.

Pair with Pokemon Center MEGA TOKYO visit. Look for card shops in the Sunshine City complex and surrounding area.

### Nakano Broadway (Tokyo) — Optional

"Treasure hunt" vibe. Good for unexpected finds and older collectibles. Browse and be selective.

### Nipponbashi / Namba (Osaka) — Days 8-9, 12

## Tips From Experience

- **Morning = less crowded** for card shops
- **Staff don't haggle** — prices are fixed
- **Condition matters** — Japanese grading is strict; NM means NM
- **Check binder AND case** — Some shops have separate displays
- **Receipt = proof** — Keep receipts for customs if buying a lot
- **Point cards** — Some chains offer them; worth getting if you'll shop multiple times
