## If Going to USJ

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Universal Studios Japan</h3>
<p>Arrive early — gates open around 8-9 AM but people line up before. July crowds are intense!</p>
<p><strong>Must-do attractions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super Nintendo World</strong> — The highlight! Mario Kart ride, interactive wristband games</li>
<li><strong>Harry Potter World</strong> — Hogwarts castle, Butterbeer</li>
<li><strong>Various coasters and rides</strong></li>
</ul>

<span>⏱️ Full day (10+ hours)</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Express Pass Strategy</h3>
<p>In July, Express Pass is almost mandatory unless you want to spend most of the day in lines.</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Express Pass 4</strong> — 4 attractions, usually includes Nintendo World</li>
<li><strong>Express Pass 7</strong> — 7 attractions, more coverage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Book early:</strong> Express Passes sell out, especially for Nintendo World entry times!</p>
</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Nintendo World Tips</h3>
<p><strong>Power-Up Band:</strong> Buy one! It's a wristband that lets you play mini-games throughout the land, collect coins, and track your progress via app.</p>
<p><strong>Toadstool Cafe:</strong> Reservation recommended (in the app) — themed food!</p>
<p><strong>Mario Kart ride:</strong> The main attraction. AR glasses + ride = incredible.</p>

## If Skipping USJ

Alternative day ideas:

- **Osaka Castle** — Historic castle with museum, nice park
- **Shinsekai** — Retro neighborhood, kushikatsu alley, Tsutenkaku Tower
- **More card shopping** — Second pass at Nipponbashi
- **Day trip** — Nara (deer park, temples) is 45 min away
- **Rest day** — Sometimes you just need one!

## Reservations Required

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="alert-title">Book These BEFORE the Trip</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>USJ Studio Pass</strong> — Basic entry ticket</li>
<li><strong>Express Pass</strong> — Skip-the-line access (sells out!)</li>
<li><strong>Nintendo World timed entry</strong> — Included with some Express Passes, or use the app day-of (but risky)</li>
</ul>
