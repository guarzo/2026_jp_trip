## Getting There

<div class="activity-block">
<div class="activity-time">🚃 Morning Train (~10 AM departure)</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Osaka to Nara</h3>
<p>Easy day trip from Osaka! Multiple train options, all around 45-50 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JR Yamatoji Line</strong> from Namba/Tennoji to JR Nara (~45 min)</li>
<li><strong>Kintetsu Line</strong> from Osaka-Namba to Kintetsu Nara (~40 min) — drops you closer to the park</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Kintetsu Nara Station is more convenient — it's a short walk to the deer and temples.</p>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Nara Park + Deer</h3>
<p>Over 1,000 wild deer roam freely in this massive park — and they're famous for bowing to get treats! Buy "shika senbei" (deer crackers) from vendors for ¥200.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The deer are wild but used to tourists — they can be pushy when they see crackers!</li>
<li>Hold crackers high and they'll bow; hide them behind your back and they'll follow you</li>
<li>Watch for deer nipping at bags and clothes looking for food</li>
<li>Great for photos — teens will love the chaos</li>
</ul>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Todai-ji Temple + Great Buddha</h3>
<p>Home to the Daibutsu — one of the largest bronze Buddha statues in the world. The temple building housing it is also one of the largest wooden structures in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Highlight:</strong> There's a pillar with a hole the same size as the Buddha's nostril. Legend says if you can squeeze through, you'll be granted enlightenment. (Teens will definitely try!)</p>
