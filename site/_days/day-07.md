## Morning

<div class="activity-time">🌅 Morning (start ~10 AM)</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
<p>The famous towering bamboo forest. Yes, it will be crowded by mid-morning — that's the reality of visiting one of Japan's most photographed spots without a 6 AM wake-up call.</p>
<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> It's still beautiful and worth seeing! The bamboo towers overhead and the light filtering through is impressive even with crowds. Walk through, take it in, and don't stress about the "perfect empty shot."</p>
<p><strong>Walk through:</strong> The grove itself is a short walk (10-15 min), but the surrounding area has more to explore.</p>

## Morning / Afternoon

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Iwatayama Monkey Park</h3>
<p>Hike up a hill to hang out with wild Japanese macaques. You can feed them from inside a hut (they roam free, you're "caged")!</p>
<p><strong>The hike:</strong> ~20 minute uphill walk. Worth it for the monkeys AND the view of Kyoto.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't make eye contact or show teeth — monkeys see it as aggression!</p>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>River Area + Cafes</h3>
<p>The Arashiyama area along the river is pleasant for strolling. Find a cafe, get some kakigori (shaved ice), rest.</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Rent a rowboat on the river, visit Tenryu-ji Temple (nice garden)</p>
</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Kimono Forest (at the station)</h3>
<p>Near Arashiyama Station, there's an installation of kimono fabric cylinders that light up at night. Pretty for photos!</p>

<h3>Rest Night</h3>
<p>July pacing matters! Take it easy tonight. Early dinner, maybe do laundry at the hotel, relax.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> Moving to Osaka!</p>
