## Early Morning

<div class="activity-block">
<div class="activity-time">🌅 Early Morning (Get there by 7-8 AM!)</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
<p>The famous towering bamboo forest. Arrive EARLY — by mid-morning it's packed with tourists and loses the magic.</p>
<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> It's beautiful but can feel crowded and "Instagram-y." Early morning is when it's actually peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Walk through:</strong> The grove itself is a short walk (10-15 min), but the surrounding area has more to explore.</p>

## Morning / Afternoon

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Iwatayama Monkey Park</h3>
<p>Hike up a hill to hang out with wild Japanese macaques. You can feed them from inside a hut (they roam free, you're "caged")!</p>
<p><strong>The hike:</strong> ~20 minute uphill walk. Worth it for the monkeys AND the view of Kyoto.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't make eye contact or show teeth — monkeys see it as aggression!</p>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>River Area + Cafes</h3>
<p>The Arashiyama area along the river is pleasant for strolling. Find a cafe, get some kakigori (shaved ice), rest.</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> Rent a rowboat on the river, visit Tenryu-ji Temple (nice garden)</p>
</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Kimono Forest (at the station)</h3>
<p>Near Arashiyama Station, there's an installation of kimono fabric cylinders that light up at night. Pretty for photos!</p>

<h3>Rest Night</h3>
<p>July pacing matters! Take it easy tonight. Early dinner, maybe do laundry at the hotel, relax.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> Moving to Osaka!</p>
