## Tips for Day 1

- **Don't fight jet lag too hard** — Stay up until a reasonable local bedtime (8-9 PM is fine)
- **Hydrate** — Long flights are dehydrating
- **Get Yen** — Airport ATM or convenience store ATM (7-Eleven works great with foreign cards)
- **Activate WiFi/SIM** — Make sure you're connected before leaving the airport
- **IC Card** — Consider getting a Suica or Pasmo card at the airport for trains
