<h3>Fushimi Inari Shrine</h3>
<p>The iconic shrine with thousands of orange torii gates. Come EARLY to beat the heat and crowds — this is non-negotiable in July!</p>
<p><strong>The hike:</strong> Full loop to the summit is ~2-3 hours. For families, doing the first 30-45 minutes gets you great photos without exhausting everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The shrine is open 24/7 and free. Early morning light through the gates is magical.</p>
