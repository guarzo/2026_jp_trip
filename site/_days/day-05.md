<h3>Fushimi Inari Shrine</h3>
<p>The iconic shrine with thousands of orange torii gates winding up the mountain. Yes, it will be crowded by mid-morning, but it's still absolutely worth seeing — the scale is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>The hike:</strong> Full loop to the summit is ~2-3 hours. For families, doing the first 30-45 minutes gets you great photos without exhausting everyone. The higher you go, the fewer people you'll encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Heat strategy:</strong> The torii gates provide partial shade. Bring water, take breaks at the small rest stops along the path, and turn back whenever you've had enough.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The shrine is open 24/7 and free.</p>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Kiyomizu-dera Area</h3>
<p>Head to the Higashiyama district. When it gets hot, duck into the many shops along the traditional streets.</p>
<p><strong>Kiyomizu-dera Temple:</strong> Famous wooden stage with views over Kyoto. Worth the walk up!</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The surrounding streets (Ninenzaka, Sannenzaka) are lined with shops and are great for escaping the heat.</p>

## Beat the Heat Strategy

| Time | Activity | Heat Level |
|------|----------|------------|
| 10:00-12:00 PM | Fushimi Inari (partial climb) | Hot but shaded |
| 12:00-3:00 PM | Lunch + indoor shops in Higashiyama | AC breaks! |
| 3:00-5:00 PM | Kiyomizu-dera + traditional streets | Still hot |
| 6:00 PM+ | Gion evening walk | Cooling down |

**Realistic expectation:** You won't beat the crowds at 10 AM, but Fushimi Inari is still magical even with people around. The higher you climb, the fewer tourists. Focus on enjoying it rather than getting the "perfect empty shot."
