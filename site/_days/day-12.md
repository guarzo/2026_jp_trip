<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Morning: Card Shop Second Pass</h3>
<p>Before the festival takes over, head back to Nipponbashi for any cards you were unsure about on Day 9.</p>
<p><strong>This is your last Osaka shopping chance!</strong></p>
<p>Buy anything you hesitated on — you won't be back to these shops.</p>
</div>

<div class="activity-card">
<h3>Afternoon: Rest + Prepare</h3>
<p>Tonight will be long and crowded. Take it easy in the afternoon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rest at the hotel</li>
<li>Eat an early dinner (finding food during the festival is challenging)</li>
<li>Charge devices — you'll want photos!</li>
</ul>

## Alternative: Sumidagawa Fireworks (Tokyo)

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="alert-title">Optional Swap</p>
<p>July 25 is also Tokyo's Sumidagawa Fireworks — one of Japan's biggest fireworks displays.</p>
<p>If you'd rather see Sumidagawa, you'd need to be in Tokyo today instead of Osaka.</p>
