<h3>Inokashira Park</h3>
<p>Beautiful park right next to the museum. Perfect for decompression — rent a swan boat, walk around the pond, find a shady bench.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Great for resetting your internal clock. Natural light + gentle activity helps beat jet lag.</p>

<h3>Optional: Evening Sensoji Walk</h3>
<p>If you have energy and are staying in Asakusa, Sensoji Temple is beautiful in the evening when it's less crowded and lit up. Just a thought if you're not quite ready for bed.</p>
